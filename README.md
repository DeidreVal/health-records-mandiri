# README
This is a small project meant to showcase an application that shows the interaction between different record tables inside a hospital databas. Note that the database contents are imaginary as well as the relationship between each table. It isn't meant to realistically reflect existing hospital database.

The application contains tables that record patient, doctor and drug data as well as a records table that hold a patient's visit history to the hospital. 

The application is also able to show the total payment that a patient owes the hospital based on the date of visit as well as the consulting doctor.

As of now, there is no security authorization setup in this project. All of the functionality available are assumed to be handled by an ADMIN role only. Future updates on this project will add security authorization for DOCTOR and PATIENT role.
